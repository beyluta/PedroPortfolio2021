# PedroPortfolio2021
Updated version of my website for the year 2021.<br>
https://www.pedroribeiro.site

## How was it made?
It was made using a paid software called Bootstrap Studio; a web design and development tool that enables you to build beautiful component-based websites using the open-source bootstrap toolkit.<br><br>

## Why not do it by hand?
While the last version of my website was made by myself without the use of any external software, what I needed was a way to quickly maintain the website and update it whenever I needed, as fast as possible. With Bootstrap Studio, it offers me a way to host the website for free while keeping my own domain name, and I can upload the files directly to the webserver with a single click. For this reason alone, I decided to use Bootstrap Studio to create my Portfolio.
